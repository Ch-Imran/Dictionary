                                                     DICTIONARY
                                                     
## INTRODUCTION:
                     A book or any source that lists the words of a language which are typically in alphabets order and gives their meaning in different languages. So basically dictionary helps people to communicate with other people of different languages. It is the collection of different words which are translated in different languages. Dictionary is helpful for those people who didnâ€™t knew the meaning of some words so he can took help from the book or having book in soft form which is the easiest way to finding the meaning.  Dictionary is a better way of understanding words. We guess it is the most best option for keep this as our project. It would be great experience for us. So it is best way to work on it as a project of Object Oriented Programming. 
             
## Working:
          In this project of dictionary using C++ having more features which will used by the user which are as follows:
          
1-Add of new word

2-Add of meaning

3-Update of Words with meaning

4-Edit of Words

5-Display 

So from the above features we conclude that the user of this project can add the word in the list of dictionary words, add the meaning in front of appropriate word, update the different words with meaning , can edit again the words and meanings of different words and at the end can display all the words in the dictionary with meanings. In this code we use classes, if-else, switch case, and file handling and through this we completed our project successfully using different concepts of Object Oriented Programming using C++.
